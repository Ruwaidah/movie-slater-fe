## Project Overview

[Trello] https://trello.com/b/8MvjHQji/labs-20-movie-knight

[Product Canvas] https://www.notion.so/Movie-Knight-2d71feaa483f4843967ca88119a72d03

[UX Design files] https://www.figma.com/file/yxTLXTgvpsFYTDdKmmjjoW/Movie-Slater-Monique-Soto-and-Harper-Atlas?node-id=1206%3A39

The best possible experience for booking movie tickets with assigned seats, as a group, or solo when the constraints of seeing a movie are variable.

Problem: 
- Choosing a movie time and theater for a group of friends to see a movie is broken and unintuitive.
- All movie booking interfaces assume you already know what time, which theater, and which movie you want to go see, and that's entirely not the case.

Mission: 
To make booking movie tickets brainless and fast. To be able to know what, where and when the group of you could go to a movie and maybe even be able to sit together.


### 4️⃣ Key Features

-    displays movies showing in theaters within the zip code you've search for
-    provides more detailed information about each movie if required
-    allows users to select their preferences for a movie going experience
-    filters available movies that match those preferences for the user

## 1️⃣ Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React

🚫 Why did you choose this framework?

-    Familiarity
-    Functional components are a simple way to reuse code
-    Client Side Routing with React-Router

🚫List the rest of the front end features and libraries in the same format as the framework above.

#### Front end deployed to AWS Amplify

#### [Back end]https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/movie-slater-be built using:

#### 🚫 Node.js and Express

-    Express provides a simple framework for build API routes
-    KnexJS allows us to write queries with JavaScript
-    MVC model

# APIs

## 2️⃣ OAuth

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

We used OAuth to allow users to log in via Google as a more seamless user experience.

## 3️⃣ Gracenote Movie API (tmsapi)

This API gives us our data on current movies showing in theatres by querying by zip code. It returns a list of all movies playing in theaters that match that zip code. In addition it is where our images for movie posters comes from.

## 3️⃣ Open Movie Database

This API gives us most of our detailed information about each movie such as cast lists, maturity ratings, reviews, run time, etc. 

# 3️⃣ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

🚫These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app

    *  REACT_APP_apiKey - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
    *  REACT_APP_authDomain - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_databaseURL - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_projectID - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_storageBucket - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_messagingSenderId - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_API - this is your public Stripe API key, generated in the Stripe dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_backendURL - optional for your local development server
    *  REACT_APP_clientid - this is the Stripe_connect clientID, generated in Stripe_connect settings
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_plan - this is the ID for a second Stripe subscription plan, generated under Stripe products



# 4️⃣ Testing

We used Jest and React-Testing-Library to test our front end code.

# 4️⃣ Installation Instructions

After cloning, CD into movie-knight, run "npm install", then "npm start" to open a live server of the react app.

## Other Scripts

    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject",
    "coverage": "CI=true yarn test --coverage || true"
